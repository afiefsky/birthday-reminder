/**
 * The reason why the worker is placed outside the `src` folder is because it's intended to be independent from the main application.
 * When it's independent, any failure or change in the worker or the main app won't affect the other.
 * This is a good practice as it improves maintainability and scalability (and observability: NewRelic, Grafana, etc).
 * 
 * For this assignment, the worker runs alongside the main application because `index.js` starts all three components (for simplicity):
 * the main app, the worker, and MongoDB.
 * 
 * In a real-world setup, this worker would be run as a separate process using a process manager like PM2.
